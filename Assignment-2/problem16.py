# 16. Imagine you are creating a Super Mario game. You need to define a
# class to represent Mario. What would it look like? If you aren't familiar
# with SuperMario, use your own favorite video or board game to model
# a player.


class SuperMario:
    height=30 
    cap= "red"
    pant= "blue"

    def run(self):
        pass


mario= SuperMario()
print("Mario has", mario.cap, " cap and ", mario.pant, " pant")
